	移植成功，能进中断，编译完成无警告。（更目录的文件要一起拷贝）
	下一步：数据解析。
	数据解析成功，获取的时间为 GMT时间，北京时间是GMT + 8点。
	下一步，解析条件分析
	 解析条件，rb.rx溢出就解析一次。 其中解析RMC时，验证出错。
	 下一步分析错误。
	 错误解决，部分验证不对。 功能实现。GPS模板成功。
	
@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use UART in interrupt mode
	Process:
		UART0 configuration:
			?9600bps 
			?8 data bit 
			?No parity 
			?1 stop bit 
			?No flow control 
			- Receive and transmit enable
					
		UART0 will print welcome screen first, then:
		 	- press any key to have it read in from the terminal and returned back to the terminal.
			- Press ESC to exit.
			- Press 'r' to print welcome screen menu again.
			
		Note: If using this example to test with UART1, pls add conversion type (LPC_UART_TypeDef *)LPC_UART1
		because UART1 has different structure type
		Ex: UART_Send((LPC_UART_TypeDef *)LPC_UART1, menu1, sizeof(menu1), BLOCKING);
		
@Directory contents:
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	 
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	uart_interrupt_test.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example, use serial display to control UART0 as the guide on screen
		
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > UART > Interrupt"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
